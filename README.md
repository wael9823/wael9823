### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Glad that you decided to visit my GitHub. My name is Wael and I am passionate about robotics and want to become a Robotics Engineer and preferably a software one at the moment. I completed my bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering in 2020 and am preparing to begin a masters in robotics in 2021. I discovered robotics in my undergrad and have loved it ever since. As I further went deeper into robotics by building some simple DIY projects, I realized that there is much I need to learn to make epic autonomous robots and have been on this learning journey since then. My main topics to learn are ROS, C++ Programming, Computer Vision, Kinematics and Motion Planning. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a robotic arm and am interested in working on other types of robots especially mobile ones!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of things bit by bit. My main focus is on learning ROS Noetic and improving my programming skills especially in C++. I'm also a bit into web development and want to make my own website.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on robotics projects and ROS and as well as website building.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with C++, ROS and figuring out to manage time effectively. Be sure to share any tips you think will be helpful.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about DIY robot projects, Arduino programming and university shortlisting for masters.
