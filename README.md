### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Glad that you decided to visit my GitHub. My name is Wael and I am passionate about robotics and want to become a Robotics Engineer and preferably a software one at the moment. I completed my bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering in 2020 and am currently pursuing a masters in robotics from Worcester Polytechnic Institute(WPI) since Fall 2021. I discovered robotics in my undergrad and have loved it ever since. As I further went deeper into robotics by building some simple DIY projects, I realized that there is much I need to learn to make epic autonomous robots and have been on this learning journey since then. Topics that I am currently focussing on and learning are ROS, C++ Programming, Computer Vision, Deep Learninng, Vision Based Manipulation and Motion Planning. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a robotic arm and am interested in working on other types of robots especially maipulator ones! My current project utilizes various ROS packages like MoveIt and PCL and the simulation work is being done in Gazebo and RVIZ. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of things bit by bit. My main focus is on learning ROS Noetic and improving my programming skills especially in C++. I'm also a bit into web development and want to make my own website in my free time.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on robotics projects and competitions.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with C++, ROS and figuring out to manage time effectively. Be sure to share any tips you think will be helpful.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about DIY robot projects, Arduino programming and university shortlisting for masters.
